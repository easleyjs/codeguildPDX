    <h1>Robert Anton Wilson</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Robert Anton Wilson (born Robert Edward Wilson; January 18, 1932 â€“ January 11, 2007) was an American author, novelist, essayist, editor, playwright, poet, futurist, and self-described agnostic mystic. Recognized by Discordianism as an Episkopos, Pope, and saint, Wilson helped publicize the group through his writings and interviews.</p>
      <p>Wilson described his work as an "attempt to break down conditioned associations, to look at the world in a new way, with many models recognized as models or maps, and no one model elevated to the truth". His goal being "to try to get people into a state of generalized agnosticism, not agnosticism about God alone but agnosticism about everything."</p>
